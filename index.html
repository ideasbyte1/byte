	<p>An edu mail, also known as an educational email or academic email, refers to an email address provided by educational institutions, typically colleges, universities, or schools. These email addresses typically end with the <b>".edu"</b> domain extension. Edu emails are often used by students, faculty, and staff members of educational institutions to communicate with each other and access educational resources and services. Edu emails are also sometimes required for eligibility in certain programs, discounts, or benefits offered exclusively to students or educational personnel.</p>
